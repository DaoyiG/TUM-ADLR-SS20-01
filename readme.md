# Advanced Deep Learning for Robotics Project SS2020

Description of the project should replace this later.

## Members:

## Information
All datas relavant to this project should be in this repo. Like literatures, codes, test results.

## Some online stuff
[Meta-Learning for Model-Based Control ](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/metaadaptivecontrol)\
On the website they give Demo-videos and link to their implementation code.

[The Rise of Meta Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-rise-of-meta-learning-9c61ffac8564)\
This blog is a comment of OpenAI's original [Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand](https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/). \
Our idea list also included this paper from OpenAI(idea 3: Investigate Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Networks).

[Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)\
This is the code base of DeepMind's bsuite. Bsuite is publicated in ICLR2020.

[Awesome-Meta-Learning](https://github.com/sudharsan13296/Awesome-Meta-Learning)\
Git repo collect all relavent papers, codes etc.

[meta-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/fhennecker/meta-reinforcement-learning)\
Somebody's Masterthesis. The code is quite straightforward.

[Tensorflow implementation of Meta-RL A3C algorithm](https://github.com/awjuliani/Meta-RL)\
Again somebody's implementation, also quite straightforward. Written in Jupyter Notebook.

[Reinforcement Learning with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-maml-rl)\
Implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) applied on Reinforcement Learning problems in Pytorch.

[Implementation of Efficient Off-policy Meta-learning via Probabilistic Context Variables (PEARL)](https://github.com/katerakelly/oyster)\
Online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience

[ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/ProMP)\
credit assignment in gradient-based Meta-RL

[Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Structured Exploration Strategies](https://github.com/russellmendonca/maesn_suite)\
Gradientbased fast adaptation algorithm – model agnostic exploration with structured noise (MAESN)

[Meta-Learning without Memorization](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/meta_learning_without_memorization)\
This is a fresh new paper from ICLR 2020. The author proposed a regularization technique for MAML. After applied this, one can train model using **non-mutually-exclusive tasks**. It would be a big success ***if we can convert this in MAML-RL algorithm*** and test it in RL background.

[MAML implementations](https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch)(https://github.com/katerakelly/pytorch-maml)\
2 repos for MAML implemetation in Pytorch
