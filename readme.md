## Information
All datas relavant to this project should be in this repo. Like literatures, codes, test results.

## Some online stuff
[OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)\
Useful tutorial for DRL. explained theory alone with code implementation written in Python using Pytorch as dependency.  

[RLLab](https://github.com/rll/rllab)\
A framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, fully compatible with OpenAI Gym. Rllab is no longer under active development, but an alliance of researchers from several universities has adopted it, and now maintains it under the name garage.  

[Garage](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage)\
Garage is a toolkit for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, and an accompanying library of state-of-the-art implementations built using that toolkit.  
Contains: MAML, PERAL, etc.

[Awesome-Meta-Learning](https://github.com/sudharsan13296/Awesome-Meta-Learning)\
Git repo collect all relavent papers, codes etc.  

[Implementation of Efficient Off-policy Meta-learning via Probabilistic Context Variables (PEARL)](https://github.com/katerakelly/oyster)\
Online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience  

[Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Structured Exploration Strategies](https://github.com/russellmendonca/maesn_suite)\
Gradientbased fast adaptation algorithm – model agnostic exploration with structured noise (MAESN)  

[Guided Meta Policy Search](https://github.com/russellmendonca/GMPS)\
This repo contains code accompaning the paper, Guided Meta-Policy Search (Mendonca et al., NeurIPS 2019).  

[Meta-Learning for Model-Based Control ](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/metaadaptivecontrol)\
On the website they give Demo-videos and link to their implementation code.

[The Rise of Meta Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-rise-of-meta-learning-9c61ffac8564)\
This blog is a comment of OpenAI's original [Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand](https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/). \
Our idea list also included this paper from OpenAI(idea 3: Investigate Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Networks).

[Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)\
This is the code base of DeepMind's bsuite. Bsuite is publicated in ICLR2020.  

[meta-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/fhennecker/meta-reinforcement-learning)\
Somebody's Masterthesis. The code is quite straightforward.

[Tensorflow implementation of Meta-RL A3C algorithm](https://github.com/awjuliani/Meta-RL)\
Again somebody's implementation, also quite straightforward. Written in Jupyter Notebook.

[Reinforcement Learning with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-maml-rl)\
Implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) applied on Reinforcement Learning problems in Pytorch.

[ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/ProMP)\
credit assignment in gradient-based Meta-RL

[Meta-Learning without Memorization](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/meta_learning_without_memorization)\
This is a fresh new paper from ICLR 2020. The author proposed a regularization technique for MAML. After applied this, one can train model using **non-mutually-exclusive tasks**. It would be a big success ***if we can convert this in MAML-RL algorithm*** and test it in RL background.

[MAML implementations1 in Pytorch](https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch)\
[MAML implementations2 in Pytorch](https://github.com/katerakelly/pytorch-maml)\
[MAML implementations3 in TF(original MAML in supervised domain](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml)\
[MAML implementations4 in TF(original MAML in RL domain)](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl)\
