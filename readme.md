## Information
All datas relavant to this project should be in this repo. Like literatures, codes, test results.

## Some online stuff
[Meta-Learning for Model-Based Control ](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/metaadaptivecontrol)\
On the website they give Demo-videos and link to their implementation code.

[The Rise of Meta Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-rise-of-meta-learning-9c61ffac8564)\
This blog is a comment of OpenAI's original [Solving Rubikâ€™s Cube with a Robot Hand](https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/). \
Our idea list also included this paper from OpenAI(idea 3: Investigate Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Networks).

[Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)\
This is the code base of DeepMind's bsuite. Bsuite is publicated in ICLR2020.
