## Project Information
This course project is base on the paper below:\
[Implementation of Efficient Off-policy Meta-learning via Probabilistic Context Variables (PEARL)](https://github.com/katerakelly/oyster)\
Online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience  

## Some online stuff
[RLkit](https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit)\
Reinforcement learning framework and algorithms implemented in PyTorch.  

[Viskit](https://github.com/vitchyr/viskit)\
rllab's viskit with some added features( visualizing learning kurve)

[Soft Actor-Critic](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/softlearning)\
This is the original version of SAC implemented in TF. The Pytorch version of SAC is in rlkit.  
  
[Tensorflow implementation of Meta-RL A3C algorithm](https://github.com/awjuliani/Meta-RL)\
Again somebody's implementation, also quite straightforward. Written in Jupyter Notebook.

[OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)\
Useful tutorial for DRL. explained theory alone with code implementation written in Python using Pytorch as dependency.  

[Garage](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage)\
Garage is a toolkit for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, and an accompanying library of state-of-the-art implementations built using that toolkit.  
Contains: MAML, PERAL, etc.

[Awesome-Meta-Learning](https://github.com/sudharsan13296/Awesome-Meta-Learning)\
Git repo collect all relavent papers, codes etc.  

[Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Structured Exploration Strategies](https://github.com/russellmendonca/maesn_suite)\
Gradientbased fast adaptation algorithm – model agnostic exploration with structured noise (MAESN)  

[meta-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/fhennecker/meta-reinforcement-learning)\
Somebody's Masterthesis. The code is quite straightforward.

[Reinforcement Learning with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-maml-rl)\
Implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) applied on Reinforcement Learning problems in Pytorch.

[MAML implementations1 in Pytorch](https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch)\
[MAML implementations2 in Pytorch](https://github.com/katerakelly/pytorch-maml)\
[MAML implementations3 in TF(original MAML in supervised domain](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml)\
[MAML implementations4 in TF(original MAML in RL domain)](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl)\
