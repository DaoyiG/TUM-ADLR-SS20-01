## Information
All datas relavant to this project should be in this repo. Like literatures, codes, test results.

## Some online stuff
[Meta-Learning for Model-Based Control ](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/metaadaptivecontrol)\
On the website they give Demo-videos and link to their implementation code.
